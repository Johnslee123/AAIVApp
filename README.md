# AAIVApp

Instructions to start app:
1. npm i
2. cd frontend
3. npm i
4. cd ..
5. npm run dev

You need to npm i in two seperate directories because the frontend and backend both have different dependencies
You also will receive the .env file seperately because of security reasons and we only want it on your local device
